# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It felt good.  It took a little extra time, but I worked through each one and am happy with my final code.  All return values are what I expected and wanted to see. I used my last day of program pairing to help get through one spot I was stuck on with partner, but otherwise I felt good.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

It is going ok.  I need to establish more of a routine before moving into MOD1.  I think a lot of it was not knowing how my schedule with MOD0 was going to unfold until the day began was a big part of that.  I took breaks when needed.  Most of the short breaks I took were to walk away from a problem I was stuck on and then come back.  That was a great way for me to regain focus.  Larger breaks in the evening to be with my family worked better than I though.  I would come back to any unfinished work around 8pm and work through it very productively. I think the few hours away from it helped me to reboot and then I came back with fresh.  I think I will be more successful with these later work session in MOD1 than I originally thought before starting MOD0.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I just need to get in a better routine.  I am used to working long hours in my previous career, although this is very different work. I need to adjust my calendar to better reflect what I have experienced in mod0.
